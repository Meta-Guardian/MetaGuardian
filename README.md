# MetaGuardian
MetaGuardian is a passive voice assistant protection system based on 3D-printed acoustic metamaterials. It is designed to effectively defend against inaudible ultrasonic attacks, adversarial audio commands, and laser injection attacksâ€”all without requiring any modification to the target device.
This repository provides everything needed to reproduce the experiments from our paper, including:

CAD File Descriptions

The MetaGuardian system includes 8 CAD files, each corresponding to a specific structural design or use case. These files enable the construction of different defense configurations for mobile devices and smart speakers:

Mobile Device Defense Structures (Assembled Versions)

`MoblieDevices-OneMic`

  Fully assembled defense structure designed for mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) with a **single microphone opening**.

`MoblieDevices-TwoMics`

  Assembled defense structure tailored for mobile devices with **dual microphone openings**, compatible with devices that have multiple mic placements.

 
 Mobile Device Structures (Unassembled â€“ without AADM)

`(Without AADM) MoblieDevices-OneMic`

  Unassembled version of the single-mic structure **without the built-in Adversarial Audio Defense Metamaterial (AADM)**. Recommended for post-3D-print **manual polishing and fine-tuning** before installing AADM.

`(Without AADM) MoblieDevices-TwoMics`

  Unassembled version of the dual-mic structure, also meant for **manual assembly** after cleaning or modifying printed parts.

 Core Defense Components (Metamaterial Units)

`AADM`

  Standalone acoustic metamaterial unit designed to defend against **adversarial audio attacks**. This is a **core module**, not including the outer casing.

`IADM`
  
  Intelligent acoustic metamaterial unit specialized for **inaudible (ultrasonic) attack defense**. Also a core component requiring integration into an outer structure.

 Mounting & Support Component

`A fixed button`

  A positioning fixture to **stabilize mobile devices** within the defense structure. Used in combination with the mobile defense designs above.

 Smart Speaker Defense Structure

`SmartSpeaker`

  A fully assembled defense structure specifically designed for **smart speakers** (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home). Includes integrated metamaterials and enclosure.
