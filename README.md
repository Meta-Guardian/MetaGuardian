# MetaGuardian
MetaGuardian is a passive voice assistant protection system based on 3D-printed acoustic metamaterials. It is designed to effectively defend against inaudible ultrasonic attacks, adversarial audio commands, and laser injection attacksâ€”all without requiring any modification to the target device.
