# MetaGuardian
MetaGuardian is a passive voice assistant protection system based on 3D-printed acoustic metamaterials. It is designed to effectively defend against inaudible ultrasonic attacks, adversarial audio commands, and laser injection attacksâ€”all without requiring any modification to the target device.
This repository provides everything needed to reproduce the experiments from our paper, including:

ðŸ§© CAD files of the custom-designed acoustic metamaterial structures

ðŸŽ§ Audio samples used for attack testing

ðŸŽ¥ Demonstration videos showing the experimental setup and process


With these materials, researchers and developers can accurately replicate our experimental workflow and validate the key mechanisms and defense performance described in the paperï¼šMetaGuardian: Enhancing Voice Assistant Security through Advanced Acoustic Metamaterials
